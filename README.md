# Main

Collection of addons made for GOL-Clan and the reason for this mod is simple, Updated with new standards for performance and easy structure.
It is also modular similar to CBA in that way.
Most functions are created by myself or someone in GOL, however if not, that person have been credited in that function

Now each module includes a couple of feature
Note: these are the main things.

3den:
* New "tab" for easy copying
* Copy highlighted units/objects, No more scripting needed, just copy and paste!
	* "Group with waypoints" (saves formation, behaviour, combat mode),
	* NOTE: This only copies waypoints highlighted.
	* "Static units" will be copied and put in to the same group.
	* "Objects" will copy both objects and vehicles for building fortifications.
	* "Vehicles" same as "Objects" but only vehicles.
* New Composition found in (Composition(F2) > Props > Custom Composition).
* Ability to create your own compositions and them to the addon.

Effects:
* Smoke: Bigger, longer lasting (extended with 15sec, total 45), slightly optimizeed performance.
* Smoke from launchers does NOT bounce, (shoot at a branch and it will not drop down).
* Revamped smoke color.
* Flares are the same as for before with GVL Enhancment, (lasting longer and increased brightness).
* Increased brightness and radius of chemlights.

Enhancment:
* X2000 flash-light are still there for backwards compatibility.
* New X3000 flash-light, a combo of X2000s wide and point versions.
* AI will use RPG 7/42 against air and infantry.
* AK-12 now only uses 545x39 caliber.
* AKM replaced with AK-74 (545x39 caliber).

Main:
* Added new GOL Difficulty and set is as standard, (should no longer need to pick difficulty).
* Hidden BIS standard mission.

Menu:
* More or less same as GOL Menu however with new standard keybinds.
* Removed unused menus.

UI:
* Removed all icons from the addAction menu..
* Map should have new contour lines.
* Removed "Statistics" from map screen.
* Added gol logo to Insignias.

Packing Instructions:
* Using Mikero's pboProject
* place the gw folder into a path: (P:/x/gw)
* also include a copy of CBA in (P:/x/cba)
* Make sure a copy of A3 unbinarized addons are located in the root directory of P:
* Finally, due to TacOps still being encrypted by BI, remove the 'retexturing' module from packing and copy the pbo into the final upload once everything else is packed.
